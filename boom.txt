GLOBAL WARMING

Global warming is the long term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-
industrial period due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat
trapping green house gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. It is the ongoing rise of the average
temperature of Earth’s climate system and has been demonstrated by direct temperature
measurements of various effects of the warming.
What causes Global warming?
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases
collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off
the earth’s surface. 
Effects of Global warming
1) Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic
water shortages and increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.
2) Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern seaboard, especially in
Florida.
3) Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy
downpours, and increased flooding.
4) Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many
plant and animal species to extinction.
5) Allergies, Asthma and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due
to increased growth of pollen-produced ragweed, higher levels of air pollution.

Green House Effect

The trapping of the sun’s warmth in a planet’s lower atmosphere, due to the greater
transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared
radiation emitted from the planet’s surface.
Radiatively active gases (green house gases) in a planet’s atmosphere radiate energy
in all directions. Part of this radiation is directed towards the surface, warming it. The
intensity of the downward radiation that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect will
depend on the atmosphere’s temperature and on the amount of greenhouse gases that the
atmosphere contains.
